# Aurelia demo
created with yo aspnet
then added in Webpack, TypeScript and Aurelia from https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation

## Getting started

Before you start, make sure you have a recent version of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment *>=4.0* with NPM 3.

From the project folder, execute the following commands:

```shell
npm install
```

dotnet restore

dotnet build
  * you  may have to delete the test directory from node_modules/selenium-webdriver/lib/test if you get jQueryToAurelia\src\aurelia\EnergyAureliaWeb\node_modules\selenium-webdriver\lib\test\data\Page.aspx.cs(4,36):


This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to
build and bundle the app. There is no need to install Webpack globally.
